-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
		The main colour scheme was selected with colour psychology and accessibility in mind. 
		
		-	#### Colour Psychology
			I researched colour psychology and found a very interesting article on Medium.com which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@bloominari/color-psychology-in-web-design-f60656b8f313). The main colour I decided to use was blue. Many tech companies use blue as their main colour as it is thought to be linked with stability, trust, security, intelligence and reliability. Cooler colours are also thought to be linked with professionalism.

		-   #### Colour Accessibility
			After deciding to use blue as the main colour I used Venngage.com to help me choose a colour palette that was attractive as well as meeting the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines as a minimum and the AAA guidelines where possible.
			
			For further information on these guidelines, you can visit the following link. [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

			I also used Coolors.co to double check each colour from the colour palette, as well as ensuring the colours still worked well inversely i.e. a white background with blue text as opposed to a blue background with white text. 

		-   #### Colour Palette and Results
			I have not tested colours #b3c7f7 and #8babf1  as I don't intend on using them in my design. Based on the below results I will aim where possible to use the the darker end of my colour spectrum in areas where text is located as much as possible to try and enhance accessibility as much as possible whilst trying to minimise the effects on the aesthetics of the website.

    -   #### Typography
        I read an article published by Google to help me select my fonts which can be found at the following link [Choosing Web Fonts: A Beginner’s Guide](https://design.google/library/choosing-web-fonts-beginners-guide/). I also read an article from w3schools.com to help me decide on a fallback font should my chosen Google font not be rendered in a users browser. That article can be found at the following link [Best Web Safe Fonts for HTML and CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php).

        - My main font will be Montserrat. This font looks good as small, medium and large sized font, so caters to accessibility. It was also updated in November 2017 and developed Cyrillic support giving a wide array of languages it can be translated into. 

        - For my fallback font I have opted for the Arial font, part of the sans-serif family. It is the most widely used font for both online and printed media. Arial is said to be one of the safest web fonts, and is available on all major operating systems. 

    -   #### Imagery
        -   The imagery I have used was chosen to depict a friendly and approachable but professional office environment. All images used on the main site page were downloaded from [Pexels]( https://www.pexels.com/). 

        -   The screenshots of dummy websites I used on the portfolio page were sourced from [Bootstrap Themes](https://bootstrapthemes.co).


*   ### Wireframes

    Due to the large image sizes and the requirement to zoom into certain elements of the wireframes I haven't embedded them and they can be downloaded from the below links.

    -   Desktop Wireframe can be found at the following link - [Desktop Wireframe](./assets/images/desktopwireframe.png)

    -   Tablet Wireframe can be found at the following link - [Tablet Wireframe](./assets/images/tabletwireframe.png)

    -   Mobile Wireframe can be found at the following link - [Mobile Wireframe](./assets/images/mobilewireframe.png)

*   ### Features

    -   Fully responsive across all screen sizes.
    -   Fully functioning and responsive Navbar, which becomes an off canvase Navbar on smaller screen sizes, operated by a burger icon.
    -   Intuitive and easy to navigate either using the navbar or additional buttons throughout the page.
    -   Introduction section giving a brief summary of the website/businses.
    -   About us section providing further in depth information on the company.

    -   A reviews section which gives the overall star rating, a link to the trusted verfiable review company, along with a carousel of some recent reviews, offering social proof to the website user.
    -   A contact us section with a contact us form, which offers prompts and has minimum requirements before the form can be submitted, to ensure all the information required to contact the user is captured.
    -   A further contact details section should the user want to reach out directly via phone or email, along with social links, the office address and map to the office.
    -   A portfolio page which highlights some recent project. The projects are highlighted on animated cards which when hovered or focused on emerge from behind the other cards and when clicked open a modal with further information on the project, the user can then click on the project image to be taken to the full site of the project. On smaller screen sizes a slider is offered so you can scroll along using a mouse or touch screen.
    -   A responsive footer providing the social links whichever page of the site you are on along with a disclaimer ensuring site visitors know this site is for educational purposes only.

*   ### Accessibility
    -   The use of semantic HTML
    -   Ensuring the colours used across the site offer a high enough contrast
    -   Ensuring all items that can be clicked on or are interactibe by hovering can also be tabbed to
    -   Using descriptive alt tags on all images
    -   Using correct aria labels where necessary
    -   Being mindful in the creation of the design to ensure it is intuitive and easy to navigate as possible

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

1.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to find out further information about the business and be able to determine as early as possible if the business offers the services that I am looking for. 
    -	A short and succinct paragraph right at the top of the homepage outlining what the company does, they should  be able to tell very quickly whether or not the services being offered are what they are looking for, they are then presented with either a button immediately below or a link in the navbar for further information should they want to explor further.
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser1.png" alt="Image of homepage hero section">
2.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate the site quickly and easily, it should take as few clicks as possible to find the section of the website I am looking for. 
    -   As well as the Navbar the users are presented with buttons at the bottom of each section leading them to the next section of the website, the logos on the page also take the user back to the home page as users have come to expect in recent times.
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser2.png" alt="Image of navbar and about us section">
3.  As a First Time Visitor, I want social proof to ensure this is a trusted business, this could be in the form of reviews or links to social media accounts where further information may be available from past and existing customers of the business.
    -   The users are presented with many forms of social proof, there is a reviews sections which shows recent reviews as well a link to a trusted review provider where reviews can be authenticated. They are also presented with social media link in the contact us section as well as the footer of the website. There is also a portfolio section where the user can view recent projects the company has worked on for other customers and businesses

    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser4.png" alt="Image of contact details section">
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser5.png" alt="Image of portfolio page">
    4.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to contact the business quickly and easily should I have any further questions that can't be specifically answered by the information on the website.
    -	There are multiple ways the user could contact the company presented through the website. There is a webform where they can submit a message to the company and once submitted they are presented with a 'thank you page' advising when they company will be in touch. If they don't want to wait this page also provides a phone number.
    -	The user is also presented with a contact details section offering further ways to get in touch via phone, email, mail in person or via various social media pages. The social media pages are also present in the footer of the website.

    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser6.png" alt="Image of thank you page">
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser4.png" alt="Image of contact details section">

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

1.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find information information about services and past or present projects the business might be working on.
    -   The portfolio section of the website offers varying examples of projects the company has previously worked on
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser5.png" alt="Image of portfolio page">
2.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the business quickly and easily with any questions I might have. 
    -   There are multiple ways the user could contact the company presented through the website.

3.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find links to social pages for further research. 
    -   The user will be able to find links to all relevant solial pages both in the contact details section as well as the footer of the website.
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser4.png" alt="Image of contact details section">

-   #### Frequent User Goals

1.  As a Frequent User, I want to keep up to date on any new project the company may have worked on.
    -   Any new projects the company may have worked on can wither be found in the portfolio page, however most users today would check a companies social pages for the most up to date news and so I have ensured these are prominently displayed and easy to find, a future additional feature I would like to see added to the site however would be a news and or blog section so more up to date information can be more easily shared
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser5.png" alt="Image of portfolio page">
    <img src="./assets/testing/firsttimeuser4.png" alt="Image of contact details section">
2.  As a Frequent User, I want to see if any new products or services have or are being launched.
    -   The services section can easily be found on the main page of the website and can be navigated from to from the Navbar, any new products or services would be listed here. However as with point one for frequent users 'pre-launch' information nowadays is usually more prominent on a companies social media pages, but again a future implementation could be a blog or news section where this information could be shared also.

### Further Testing
<br>

-   HTML Validator - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
    -   Homepage

        [Homepage HTML Validator Test 1](./assets/testing/html1.pdf)

        [Homepage HTML Validator Test 2](./assets/testing/html2.pdf)

        -   Warning 1 – h1 element not used as a top line element, I believe this was caused by using an article element inside a section element which from research seems to be redundant, when I changed the article inside the section to a div element the error was resolved. 

        -   Warning 2 – Was in regard to the same section as error 1 not having any heading, again I believe this was due to the way it was structured as this was also resolved by changing the article element to a div. 

        -   Error 4, 6 and 8 were all related to the same error in the HTML structure, once I corrected by removing the redundant article tags the warnings disappeared.

        -   Error 9 was in relation to the 'allowfullscreen' attribute within the iframe of google maps showing as “false”, a quick google search reveals this shouldn’t have a value, so to not allow full screen you should just remove the attribute all together which I have now done and resolved the error.

    -   Portfolio Page

        [Portfolio Page HTML Validator Test 1](./assets/testing/portfoliohtml1.pdf)

        [Portfolio Page HTML Validator Test 2](./assets/testing/portfoliohtml2.pdf)

        -   Warnings 1 and 2 were both caused by the same structure issues as the main page and were resolved in the same way.
        -   Errors 3 to 9 were caused by not linking the 'aria-labelledby' attribute to the id of the labelling element correctly which has now been corrected and has resolved the errors.

    -   Thankyou Page

        [Thankyou Page HTML Validator Test 1](./assets/testing/thankyouhtml1.png)

        [Thankyou Page HTML Validator Test 2](./assets/testing/thankyouhtml2.png)

        -   Warnings 1 and 2 were both caused by the same structure issues as the main page and were resolved in the same way.

-   CSS Validator - [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    -   Homepage

        [CSS Validator Test 1](./assets/testing/cssvalidator1.png)

        [CSS Validator Test 2](./assets/testing/cssvalidator2.png)

        -   1 error found, missing unit value for the width of the logo in the footer.        
        -   All warnings are in relation to using a vendor extended pseudo-element of extension for various stylings throughout the page which I believe can be ignored in this instance.


<br>

-   Lighthouse
    
    The main issue with initial testing was page load times due to images sizes and suggested using nextgen formats, I converted the png and jpeg images to webp using [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com/) to improve performance.

    Accessibility – Serving headings in sequential descending order – I believe this is due to have a 1 page site, so where there is a h2 heading services section, then a h4 and h5 heading respectively, the reviews section further down would then start with a new h2 heading. After some research it would seem this wouldn't cause a problem.

    Lighthouse also suggests using passive listeners to improve scroll performance specifically related to the map function, however I beliebe this would be outside of scope of this project and also outside my capabilities at present.

    Lighthouse also suggests to serve static assets with an efficient cache policy, using long cache policies to improve future load times for users, but this is beyond the scope of the project and again my capabilities but something that could be implemented in future.

    The last warning from Lighthouse suggested that image elements should have explicit width and height to improve CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift). However I have allowed the images to change size to improve the aesthetics on different screen sizes rather than loading a differently sized image on different screensizes which I think would effect page load speeds more.

-   Browser Errors
    -   Chrome

        Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'. – After some research it seems this tells google whether or not you would opt into FLoC and can be safely ignored for the purposes of this project.

        Edge browser returned the same error as Chrome however as it is built in Chromium this is to be expected.

### Bugs

-   Bug 1 – Couldn’t make text bold on navbar without moving the other inline elements. There was a solution on Stack Overflow to create a hidden sudo class with the same styling to avoid this, however a simpler method instead which involved less coding and playing round with the structure of the default styling of the Bootstrap navbar was to create a text shadow instead which gives a very similar effect, however this turned out to be a slightly better fix as after playing around with sizing of the shadow and the blur effect I was able to give the text a slightly glowing effect instead of just the bold - [Solution found here](https://pupungbp.com/how-to-give-bold-on-hover-without-shifting-another-element/)

-   Bug 2 – Navbar wouldn’t collapse when a link was clicked. This seems to be a common bug with bootstrap that can be fixed using javascript, however this is beyond my capabilities or scope of this project so instead I opted for an off canvas navbar. I set the width to a maximum of 70% of the viewport width so the user can see that the scrolling has taken them to the correct part of the page, the user can then use the X button or click out of the menu box to view their selected content. I feel this is a more intuitive design as with a drop down menu bar that didn’t “auto-hide” they may not have realised they needed to reclick the menu icon and there was no visual indication the link they had clicked had worked either. 

-   Bug 3 – Section headings hiding behind navbar when clicked – Scroll margin top – [Solution found here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pr_scroll-margin-top.php). 
I also discovered later you could just add padding to the body element to clear all content from behind the navbar. Scroll margin top has worked fine for this project but I will bear this in mind for future projects.

-   Bug 4 – On page buttons weren’t working every time after using navbar links for example. [Found solution here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2906582/how-do-i-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link#:~:text=The%20plain%20HTML%20way%20is,URL%20in%20the%20action%20attribute.&text=If%20necessary%2C%20set%20CSS%20display,type%3D%22submit%22%3E%20).
Moved action="#about-us" from the button element it’s self to the parent form element which seems to have fixed the issue.

-   Bug 5 – CSS images not working on deployed site – Didn’t have the correct relative directory path.

-   Bug 6 – Can’t submit form as there is no backend to the website, so the submit button just forwards to the Thankyou page.

-   Bug 7 – The carousel previous and next buttons worked fine but the indicator buttons at the bottom were not, as they were added later on the data-bs-target attribute was targeting the wrong ID for the carousel. Changed to the correct ID now all seem to be working fine.

-   Bug 8 – Images on the cards on the portfolio page were not focusable or tabbable, they could only be interacted with using a mouse. They could be added to the tab index but once tabbed to, the space bar or return key would not launch the modal. Using an 'a' tag instead of a 'div' wouldn’t launch the Modal either. I noticed on the bootstrap documentation all the modals were launched from a button and they were tabbable and would launch using spacebar or return key. As a work around I made the images into buttons, this has no effect to the styling but makes it so the you can interact with the images and therefore better for accessibility.

-   Bug 9 – When the home page images could not load or were unavailable the alt text was unreadable in some places and would also alter the styling and positioning of other text in the same section which could make it unreadable. I instead turned the div into an image container with basic styling to make the alt text more readable and so that it has less of an effect on page styling.

-   Bug 10 - Whilst not a bug as such using [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=%3A%3A-webkit-scrollbar) it transpired that Firefox doesn't support scrollar styling, however this doesn't detract from the funcionality only really the aesthetics of the site. 

### Unsolved Bugs
 
-   Bug 1 – When asking someone else to test the website functionality for me it was discovered navbar links that used anchor tags to the sections of the home page would only work once the page was refreshed. Links away from the page such as the portfolio page and external links worked fine as well as the home link. This meant whilst you could still navigate the whole website it reduces the user experience on iphone. This issue does not exist on any other apple devices we tested such as macs, laptops or ipads. I tried several fixes but from my research it seems the only fix for this issues requires knowledge of javascript which is beyond my capability as present.
