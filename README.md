## User Experience (UX) 

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to find out further information about the business and be able to determine as early as possible if the business offers the services that I am looking for. 
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate the site quickly and easily, it should take as few clicks as possible to find the section of the website I am looking for.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want social proof to ensure this is a trusted business, this could be in the form of reviews or links to social media accounts where further information may be available from past and existing customers of the business. 
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to contact the business quickly and easily should I have any further questions that can't be specifically answered by the information on the website. 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find information information about services and past or present projects the business might be working on.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the business quickly and easily with any questions I might have. 
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find links to social pages for further research. 

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to keep up to date on any new project the company may have worked on.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to see if any new products or services have or are being launched.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
		The main colour scheme was selected with colour psychology and accessibility in mind. 
		
		-	#### Colour Psychology
			I researched colour psychology and found a very interesting article on Medium.com which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@bloominari/color-psychology-in-web-design-f60656b8f313). The main colour I decided to use was blue. Many tech companies use blue as their main colour as it is thought to be linked with stability, trust, security, intelligence and reliability. Cooler colours are also thought to be linked with professionalism.

		-   #### Colour Accessibility
			After deciding to use blue as the main colour I used Venngage.com to help me choose a colour palette that was attractive as well as meeting the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines as a minimum and the AAA guidelines where possible.
			
			For further information on these guidelines, you can visit the following link. [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

			I also used Coolors.co to double check each colour from the colour palette, as well as ensuring the colours still worked well inversely i.e. a white background with blue text as opposed to a blue background with white text. 

		-   #### Colour Palette and Results
			I have not tested colours #b3c7f7 and #8babf1  as I don't intend on using them in my design. Based on the below results I will aim where possible to use the the darker end of my colour spectrum in areas where text is located as much as possible to try and enhance accessibility as much as possible whilst trying to minimise the effects on the aesthetics of the website.
